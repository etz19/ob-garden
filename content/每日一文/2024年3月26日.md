 One reason Hollywood is so much more taxing than other creative fields is because it's so expensive to make anything. But this is all about to change because of AI.
It's not just visual effects that can be done with drag-and-drop algorithms. It's everything. Text-only LLMs like ChatGPT can already write mediocre scripts. The same is true for start-ups that enable you to create the score for a film using a full philharmonic of brass, woodwinds, percussion, and strings.

好莱坞之所以比其他创意领域更加费力的一个原因是因为制作任何作品的成本都非常高。但是，由于人工智能的发展，这一切即将发生变化。
这不仅仅是可以通过拖放算法完成的视觉效果。一切都在变。仅靠文本的大型语言模型（LLM）如ChatGPT已经能够写出中等水平的剧本。同样，有些初创公司能够让你使用完整的铜管乐、木管乐、打击乐和弦乐部分来创作电影配乐。
