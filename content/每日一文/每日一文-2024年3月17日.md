In 1935, Harper’s Magazine published a sorrowful article about young Americans. The authors, journalists George Leighton and Richard Hellman, argued that a generation was “rotting before our eyes”. Apathy and disenchantment were taking hold, together with criminality. Even high-school students were packing guns and were “out for what they can get”. Leighton and Hellman blamed mass unemployment for this tragedy. Some of their contemporaries pointed at marijuana.

1935年，《哈珀杂志》发表了一篇关于年轻美国人的悲伤文章。作者、记者乔治·莱顿和理查德·赫尔曼认为，一个世代正在“我们眼前腐烂”。冷漠和幻灭正蔓延开来，犯罪也随之增加。甚至连高中生都带着枪，只为“能得到什么就拿什么”。莱顿和赫尔曼将这场悲剧归咎于大规模失业。他们的一些同时代人则指向了大麻。

Around 50 years after that article—and 40 years after the supposedly rotten generation had saved the world from fascism—older people again complained that the young were going awry. In a book, “The Disappearance of Childhood” (1982), Neil Postman, an educational theorist, argued that teenagers were adopting adult vices such as heavy drinking and crime, and having far too much sex. The chief culprit, he explained, was television.

大约在那篇文章发表50年后，也就是那个被认为腐烂的一代从法西斯主义中拯救世界40年后，老一辈人再次抱怨年轻人偏离了正轨。在一本名为《童年的消失》(1982年)的书中，教育理论家尼尔·波斯特曼认为，青少年采纳了成人的恶习，如酗酒、犯罪，并且性行为过多。他解释说，主要的罪魁祸首是电视。

Two more books have now been published about the troubles and flaws of young people. They say almost nothing about unemployment, marijuana or tv; indeed, they do not agree with each other about why the young are in such a mess. The causes change, the measurements change. What does not change is the absolute certainty with which older adults hold forth on the problems of youth.

现在又出版了两本关于年轻人问题和缺陷的书。它们几乎不提失业、大麻或电视；实际上，它们对于年轻人为何陷入如此混乱的状态也没有达成一致。原因在变，衡量标准在变。但不变的是，老年人对年轻人问题的绝对确定性。

“The Anxious Generation” describes a cohort suffering from unprecedented levels of mental ill-health. One-fifth of American students were diagnosed with or treated for depression in 2019, up from one-tenth a decade earlier. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University, argues this is not just a sign of increased frankness. Suicides are rising too, more than doubling among American 10- to 14-year-old girls since 2010.

《焦虑的一代》描述了一群遭受前所未有的心理健康问题的人。2019年，五分之一的美国学生被诊断出患有抑郁症或接受了治疗，比十年前的五分之一有所增加。纽约大学的社会心理学家乔纳森·海特认为，这不仅仅是坦率增加的标志。自杀率也在上升，2010年以来，美国10至14岁女孩的自杀率翻了一番还多。

Smartphones and social media are the chief villains. Instead of small, stable real-world communities, young people join virtual ones, where they experience “a daily tornado of memes, fads, and ephemeral micro-dramas, played out among a rotating cast of millions of bit players”. Smartphones are so alluring that they reduce interest in all other activities. Reversing Postman’s complaint about teenagers in the 1980s, Mr Haidt says that modern ones are slow to date and to have sex.

智能手机和社交媒体是主要的罪魁祸首。年轻人加入的不是小型稳定的现实世界社区，而是虚拟社区，在那里他们经历着“每日的梦幻、时尚和短暂微剧，由数百万临时演员上演”。智能手机极具吸引力，以至于它们减少了对所有其他活动的兴趣。海特先生反驳了波斯特曼关于1980年代青少年的投诉，称现代青少年在约会和性行为方面较为迟缓。
