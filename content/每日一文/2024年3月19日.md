Kate, Princess of Wales and wife to Prince William, has not been seen in public since Christmas Day. On January 17, Kensington Palace announced that Kate had entered the hospital the day before for planned abdominal surgery. It added that she was "unlikely" to resume her public duties until Easter.

威廉王子的妻子、威尔士王妃凯特自圣诞节以来未再公开露面。1月17日，肯辛顿宫宣布，凯特于前一天入院接受了计划中的腹部手术，并补充说她“不太可能”在复活节之前恢复公务。
